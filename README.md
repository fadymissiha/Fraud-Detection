# Fraud-Detection
# Initial Fraud Detection ML model and Flask App to provide service work in the Red Hat OpenShift Cloud Environment.

Fraud monitoring and prevention are the most challenging and costly financial businesses. For example, in 2018, $24.26 Billion was lost due to payment card fraud. Banks and financial houses try to reduce fraud by investing much money in software development. The United States leads as the most credit fraud-prone country, with 38.6% of reported card fraud losses in 2018. (Shiftprocessing, 2022)
Analyzing the features of the transactions using machine learning like the logistic regression model could statistically significantly identify the fraudulent transactions, and the study results could be used as proof of concept to develop applications in the future for fraud monitoring and prevention.  
Machine learning can be a powerful and influential tool in one of the most challenging and restricted sectors and will drive to increasing the trust for more safe transactions and more financial revenue.

Data Description
	Finding a dataset for the historical financial transactions was not easy, including the necessity to answer the research question; any data related to the financial sector is hard to find. The dataset must include enough transactions to train and test the model.
	Some of the included transactions must be classified as fraud to be healthy data for training the model. The transaction features should identify the fraud transaction characteristics and properties and include a dependent variable that will train the model by labeling or classifying the fraud or non-fraud transactions.
	The research will use a dataset in a CSV file format named "Fraud Detection Classification" downloaded from Kaggle.com, covering all needed requirements.
	The dataset is available to the public, does not include any restriction data, includes 101613 transactions(rows) and ten columns. The dataset is a sample and an excellent example of answering the research question and analyzing the transactions. (Kaggle, 2022)
